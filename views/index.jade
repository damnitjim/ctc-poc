              Click To Call allows customers to engage with support by requesting
              a phone call from a support agent. The information collected from the
              customer at the time of request allows the support agent to provide
              personalized and contextualized engagement.


            h4 User Requests A Call
            p.
              In this scenario, a user navigates to a form that requests a few key pieces of information including: their phone number, their reason for requesting a phone call, and a ticket number, if applicable. Behind the scenes, the form is also collecting their account number, account name, contact number, contact name, and what URL they were browing when they decided they needed to request a phone call. If there are any analytics tracking beacon IDs, those could also be included.

            p.
              The user enters in the necessary information, clicks 'Request A Call' and receives a notification of what number they should expect to receive a phone call from.

            h4 Orchestrate The Request
            p.
              The values for the requested call are written to a datastore and a unique key is generated. The service makes an API request to Twilio requesting a call be placed between the customer service phone line and the customer and including a unique callback url for the requested call.

            p.
              Twilio initiates the phone call between the customer service phone line and the customer. After the customer answers, the callback URL is fired. The service accepts the callback and makes a TwiML Voice request that causes Twilio to read a customized greeting to the customer. The service finishes by making an API request for Twilio to have the customer servcie phone line connect to an agent's phone and bridging that call with the customer.
